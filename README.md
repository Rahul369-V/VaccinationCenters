COVID vaccination centers full stack project involves different types of users, including regular users and administrators. I have also implemented protected routes for both user types, authentication functionality, and CRUD operations using Firebase Firestore(No sql based database📑).

## Implemented Functionalities
- Separate Authentication for both regular users and administrators🔓
- Maintained the protected routes between both users🔐
- Regular client can  book a slot for their vaccinnation (only 10 slots available per center)
- Admin can add, delete the vaccination centers and able to Get dosage details 💉
- Logout Functionalities🔐
